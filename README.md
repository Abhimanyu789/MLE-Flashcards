# Machine Learning Engineer - Flashcards

These are flashcards I made to prepare for machine learning engineer interviews and review everything from my time doing research, taking classes, and independent study. Using them, I was able to get offers from several FAANG-like companies. Hopefully other people can benefit from them as well!

The PDFs in this repo are mostly for convenience. Check out the links below for the most up to date and animated versions, with additional links in the speaker notes:

# Intended Scope and Audience

The flashcards covers topics relating to computer science, classical machine learning, and modern deep learning with an emphasis on computer vision. They generally assume a good foundation in these topics, and a lot of technicaal terminology is used. I think the approach might be different depending on your current experience:

* If you already have a good foundation  in ML, and want to review (e.g. to prep for interviews), you can probably use them as is

* If you are newer to ML, and want to have an overview of what is out there, with the option to learn 

Note that some flashcards are more important than others. From my experience interviewing at 10+ companies, these are the most important slides:
