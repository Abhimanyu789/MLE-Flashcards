# Machine Learning Engineer - Flashcards

These are flashcards I made to review everything from my years of ML research, classes, and independent study. I used them to prepare for machine learning engineer interviews and was able to get offers from several companies (including Google, Tesla, Samsung, Motional, UiPath, and TikTok). Hopefully other people can benefit from them as well!

The PDFs in this repo are mostly for convenience. __Check out these presentation slide links for the most up to date and animated versions__, with additional links in the speaker notes:

# Intended Scope and Audience

This covers computer science, classical machine learning, and modern deep learning with an emphasis on computer vision. It generally assumes a good foundation in these topics, and a lot of technical terminology is used. I think the approach might be different depending on your current experience:

* Already have a __good foundation in ML__: you can probably use them __as-is to review__ and fill in any missing knowledge gaps

* __Newer to ML__, this may provide a good overview of what is out there, and I'd suggest subsequently __refering to other materials focused on education__ & learning (see "additional links" below)

# Important Slides

In my opinion, these are the most important slides:

* Machine Learning General: 1,
* Fundamentals for Computer Vision & Deep Learning: 1,
* Selected Topics in Computer Vision & Deep Learning: 1,

# Contributing

There may be errors in these slides, or things that I've missed. If so, feel free to make a post as an issue in github.

__*Please mark the slide in question so others can easily find it, e.g. if you see an issue in Machine Learning General slide 14, add [1.14] to the title.*__

# Additional Links & Resources

If you're interviewing for MLE roles, conceptual ML knowledge is only a third of what you need to know. The other usual components are programming questions, and behaviorial questions based on projects you've done in the past. Here are some useful resources to help with everything:

* The most useful resource I've found to learn about the MLE interview process holistically
  * https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/
* Useful course materials for ML from stanford and UC Berkeley

* Resources for the programming portion
